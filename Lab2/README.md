This contains the files necessary to run Lab 2, designing a maze.

Note that, as stated in the blog post, there is sometimes a random glitch in the code where an exception is raised upon touching a body. I am not sure why this happens, as the error message provides absolutely no useful information ("AssertionError" is all I see on the Processing console) and the glitch occurs randomly. It could be related to the rendering or removing of the dynamic bodies, but I did not want to spend much time on trying to fix the issue since a simple workaround is restarting the sketch.
